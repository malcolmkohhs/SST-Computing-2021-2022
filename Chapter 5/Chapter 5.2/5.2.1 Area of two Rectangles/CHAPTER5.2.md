# Area of Two Rectangles
A set of four integers {x1, y1, x2, y2}, where (x1, y1) is the bottom left coordinate  and (x2, y2) is the top right coordinate of a rectangle.
You are guaranteed that 0 <= x1 <= x2 <= 10000 and 0 <= y1 <= y2 <= 10000.
You are given two sets of data, for rectangle A and B.
Write a program to find the total area covered by both rectangles.
Note: Some areas maybe be covered by both rectangles.
