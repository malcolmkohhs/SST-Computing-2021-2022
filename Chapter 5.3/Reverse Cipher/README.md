Given a cipher text, CT, find the shift value for a and b.
Note: You know that within the plaintext is the word "duck" (in any combinations of upper and lower cases)
Write a function 
revCipher(CT)
that will return two integer, a and b, where both are shift values of alphabets in odd and even index(position) respectively.
