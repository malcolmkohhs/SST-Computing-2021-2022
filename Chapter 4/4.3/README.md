After the 2.4km class run, you are given the data in the form of a list.
The list index is used as student reg.no.
Student reg.no. 1 finished 5th in the class run.
Student reg.no. 2 finished 6th in the class run.
etcâ€¦
				
Create a new list in which index is the finished position 
number and store the corresponding student reg.no.

Reg No   Finished Position
1        5
2        6
3        3
4        1
5        4
6        2

Example:
data_in = [5, 6, 3, 1, 4, 2]
new_data = [4, 6, 3, 5, 1, 2]
