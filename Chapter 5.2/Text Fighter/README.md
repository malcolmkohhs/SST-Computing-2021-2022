# Text Fighter
Write a program to simulate a fighting game using purely text based interface.
The character should have 100 health points
The character should have a variety of skill set (Recommendation is 3 offensive and 2 defensive skills.)
Player will play against the computer. The computer will randomly choose from the available skill sets. Your program will match the two selected skills/abilities and apply the necessary results.
When one character's health points is reduced to 0, that character is defeated and the opponent wins.
You can introduce other resources apart from health points, for example each abilities may required stamina or mana to use. In this case, there must be method(s) to gain the said resources.
